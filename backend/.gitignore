# Pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   with no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
